    <body>
        <p>Hi, there! My name is Ayanna Tournay-Hall. I am 25 years old and my pronouns are they/them. I've grown up in <br>
        North Carolina. I'm currently attending school for an IT degree, but making art is my first passion. My art style is focused more<br>
        on animated styles with traditional pencil and paper but I try to work with every style and medium</p>

        <p>Other facts</p>
            <ul>
                <li>My favorite vacation spot is Washington D.C. I love going to museums and seeing 
                    all the history, beautiful scenery, and multiple cultures there. My family goes up there almost
                    every year and we still always find something we haven't done or seen before.
                </li>
                <li>You wouldn't know it by looking at me, but I am disabled. I have an autoimmune condition called fibromyalgia and I have
                    arthritis in my spine.
